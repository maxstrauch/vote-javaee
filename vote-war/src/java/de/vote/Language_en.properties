About.description = <p class="about">\
Vote! is a program for creating and executing online polls. \
Once you have signed up as an organizer you can create polls with an arbitrary \
number of questions, each one consisting of an arbitrary number of options. \
After adding all participants to your poll, they automatically receive an \
invitation e-mail. At the end of the poll its results can be viewed online. \
</p><p class="about"> \
Yet the Vote!-system does not allow to show results before a poll is finished. \
Additionally, not even a Vote!-administrator can trace back which participant \
casted a certain vote. \
</p>

About.footerIntro = Vote! has been developed at the University of Koblenz-Landau, \
Germany within the scope of the course "JavaEE Web-Applikationen".

About.footer = Vote! Version {0} Daniel Vivas Estevao, \
Maximilian Strauch. Build and designed by hand with &#x2764;.
