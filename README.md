# ![Vote! program icon](/vote-logo-sm.png?raw=true "Vote! program icon") Vote!

Vote! is a web-based application for creating and executing online polls based on JavaEE. Once you have signed up as an organizer you can create polls with an arbitrary number of questions, each one consisting of an arbitrary number of options. After adding all participants to your poll, they automatically receive an invitation e-mail. At the end of the poll its results can be viewed online.

**Further information, screenshots and development documents can be obtained [in the project archive here](http://maxstrauch.github.io/projects/vote-exclamation-mark/index.html).**
